# Manage Your Dotfiles

## Install

Clone this repository into the root of your Dropbox account.

		$ git clone git@github.com:emson/dotfiles.git ~/Dropbox/

Then open the terminal and navigate to your cloned `dotfiles` directory:

		$ cd ~/Dropbox/dotfiles
		$ assign_all.sh

NB If you already have a `~/.ssh/` directory you will have to manually move it.
